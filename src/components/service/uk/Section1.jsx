                In the year ending March 2020, formal study was the foremost
                reason for immigration (36%), while work was the second most
                typical reason (32%). Education was the main reason for
                immigration during the amount 2009-12, and therefore the
                reduction within the number of individuals migrating to the
                united kingdom to review since then reflects a reduction within
                the number of Tier 4 student visas issued to students from
                outside the EEA and Switzerland. In 2018, study once more became
                the foremost common reason for immigration to the United
                Kingdom, consistent with the estimates.
